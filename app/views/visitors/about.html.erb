        <p>We’re all working together for someone, right? You may call them fans, customers, users, or a target audience. Our preferred terminology is just “people”. In most cases with our work, we’re doing what we do for <strong>Millenial and Gen Z people.</strong>

        They prioritize freedom and embrace technology. They love to share and hate to wait. They’re socially conscious, culturally aware, politically active, and more collaborative than any generations before them. They value people and experiences over things. <br class="hidden-xs"/><strong>We know these people because we are these people.</strong>
